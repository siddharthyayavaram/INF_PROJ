# Informal_Formal
Classifying Formal and Informal sentences through various Natural Language Processing Methods including
∗ Analysing similarity of words through BERT, MURIL,multilingual BERT embeddings.
∗ Back- translation using google translate API before comparing Jaccard similarity
∗ End to end RNN and BERT based classifier and used GPT model for next word prediction
∗ Graphical analysis of POS(Parts-of-speech) tagging
∗ K-means clustering of high dimensional embeddings and subsequent visualization
